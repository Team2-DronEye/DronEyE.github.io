    <p1>Check out a limited amount of places around the world through a 
        live drone before making a decision of visiting the location or travel digitally. 
        This product would be paid through a subscription. You would also be able to contact other drones 
        with this product to ask their opinions on the locations or maybe if they know where to find 
        something at a certain area.</p1>
